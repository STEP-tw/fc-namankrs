        <b> Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a
        monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It
        consists of one species, <b> Abeliophyllum distichum </b>Nakai, endemic
        to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven
        sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not
        yellow, flowers.<br />
        It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
        opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
        above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new
        leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a
        four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm
        diameter.<br /><br />
        It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.<br /><br />
